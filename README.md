# Homii-
Due to the great impact of technology in human life and its presence in the smallest details of their lives, and with the increase in the number of service programs and their multiplicity and diversity in terms of their mechanism of work and their communication with the user and the environments they work with, we are today in an era of variables and speed, so we will constantly need to develop software that serves the human and develops his lifestyle and solves problems he encounters. Therefore, given that the future of the country and its reconstruction rests on the studentâ€™s burden, and the future of the student depends on their comfort and continuity, the idea of our project came to help the student to secure suitable housing at an appropriate price to help them complete their study journey in comfort and continuity, by collecting donations and offering discounts on rent prices to the student.
